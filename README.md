**PROTESTORY!** is a web application that offers a playful exploration of protest cultures of working-class youth from the early 20th century until today. 

**PROTESTORY!** shows the diversity of materials that were created in the context of youth protests in the past decades and still shape our impression of these protests today.

With the various aesthetic-narrative mini-applications, users can discover the exciting world of past youth protest cultures. 
The historical resources, all from the Archive of the Workers´ Youth Movement, serve both as a source of knowledge and inspiration. 
In addition, it is intended to encourage users to perceive archives as a place for writing history and for the systematic collection of current youth protests.

**PROTESTORY!** is a project of the Archive of the Workers´ Youth Movement and was implemented together with the company Digitalwarenkombinat. 
The project **PROTESTORY!** has been developed as part of "dive in. Programme for Digital Interactions" of the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (German Federal Cultural Foundation) with funding by the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media (BKM) through the NEUSTART KULTUR programme.”

The digital items were taken from the collection of the Archive of the Workers´ Youth Movement, which made them available to us.
